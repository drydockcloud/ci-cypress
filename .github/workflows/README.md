# Workflows

## docker-hub.yml

Workflow is used to publish a Docker image to docker hub on release.

The docker hub URL: https://hub.docker.com/r/drydockcloud/ci-cypress

We use an access token that is created by member who has access to docker hub and the username and password is added to
GitHub as a repository secret. Names are `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` respectively.
